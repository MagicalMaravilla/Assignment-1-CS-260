Bag of marbles
Find a way to create, interact, remove, and add marbles as needed, and find some utilization with marbles.
My first attempt will be to 
1.) take marbles in and out
2.) take a random amount of marbles out
3.) give the marbles colors for each one pulled
4.) attempt to sort or count how many marbles in total, how many of each color as well.
